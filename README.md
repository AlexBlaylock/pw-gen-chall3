This is a password generator that I refactored. This was done for week 3 of my bootcamp. 

The outside purpose of this project is to generate a password that is (although limited and random) customizable. The purpose of this project for my boot camp is to practice and work on my JavaScript, in particular functions and if statements and using window alerts or prompts.

JavaScript was a language that I am weak in, it took me a lot of reading on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ to catch up for time I missed in class. I believe that my project came out strong still and I'm proud of the work that I have done.
